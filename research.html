            to a wide range of applications—from portable field instruments to high-precision
            lab-based tribometers that ensure reproducible results across laboratories worldwide.
            Our custom-built devices are specifically designed to operate under a broad range of
            conditions, including extreme loads, speeds, and environmental factors, and are also
            developed for use in real-world field measurements. Our primary focus is on investigating
            friction management products for railhead and wheel flange contact, and we are
            actively working to develop standardized, step-by-step testing protocols to
            reliably assess and compare product performance.</p>
